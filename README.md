# Netscan - ARP Detective System

Netscan is an ARP Detective system designed to help network administrators identify potential ARP spoofing attacks on their networks. However, it is currently experiencing a high rate of false positives. We welcome contributions from the community to help improve its accuracy.

## How It Works

Netscan uses a combination of ARP requests and known MAC address tracking to detect discrepancies in the network. While the current implementation is functional, it may generate false alerts in certain scenarios.
